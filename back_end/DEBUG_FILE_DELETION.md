# Quick Debug Guide for File Deletion 404 Errors

## Immediate Steps

### 1. Start Server with Enhanced Logging
```bash
cd chat-with-your-excel/back_end
python start_with_logs.py
```

### 2. Open Log Viewer in Another Terminal
```bash
cd chat-with-your-excel/back_end
python view_logs.py --follow
```

### 3. Trigger the Error
1. Upload a file through your frontend
2. Try to delete it
3. Watch the logs in real-time

## What You'll See in Logs

### Successful Upload
```
üì§ UPLOAD FILE REQUEST
   Generated file ID: c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462
   Save path: /path/to/storage/c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462_filename.xlsx
   ‚úÖ File written to disk
   üéâ Upload completed successfully
```

### Failed Delete (404 Error)
```
üóëÔ∏è DELETE FILE REQUEST
   File ID: c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462
   Storage directory: /path/to/storage
   Files in storage (2): ['other_file.xlsx', 'session_123.json']
   ‚ùå File not found by ID: c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462
   Files matching pattern 'c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462_*': []
   ‚ùå Failed to delete file after 3 attempts
```

### Successful Delete
```
üóëÔ∏è DELETE FILE REQUEST
   File ID: c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462
   Files in storage (3): ['c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462_data.xlsx', ...]
   ‚úÖ File deleted successfully on attempt 1
```

## Key Diagnostics

### Check 1: Domain Mismatch
Look for request headers:
```
üîÑ DELETE https://09f57b9bbb56.ngrok-free.app/api/files/c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462
   Headers: {'origin': 'https://d6e27daed44c.ngrok-free.app', ...}
```

**Problem**: Different ngrok domains for frontend vs backend
**Solution**: Set consistent `.env` files

### Check 2: File Not Found
```
Files in storage (1): ['different-file-id_something.xlsx']
Files matching pattern 'c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462_*': []
```

**Problem**: File uploaded to different backend instance
**Solution**: Use same ngrok URL for all operations

### Check 3: Double Request
```
üóëÔ∏è DELETE FILE REQUEST (first request)
   ‚úÖ File deleted successfully on attempt 1

üóëÔ∏è DELETE FILE REQUEST (same file ID, 100ms later)
   ‚ùå File not found by ID: c75414cd-5244-4a11-a8a8-d399db413462
```

**Problem**: Double-clicking delete button
**Solution**: Disable button during delete operation

## Environment Files Needed

### Backend `.env`
```env
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
NGROK_ORIGIN=https://d6e27daed44c.ngrok-free.app
```

### Frontend `.env`
```env
VITE_API_BASE=https://09f57b9bbb56.ngrok-free.app/api
```

**Important**: Replace URLs with your actual ngrok URLs!

## Next Steps After Diagnosis

1. **If domain mismatch**: Fix `.env` files and restart both frontend and backend
2. **If double requests**: Implement button disabling in frontend
3. **If file truly missing**: Check if multiple backend processes are running

The enhanced logging will show you exactly what's happening during each delete attempt.
